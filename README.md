## About The Project

The problem AI-Powered-Trend-Analyzer solves
With the rise of platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit, businesses and marketers face the challenge of keeping up with the constant flow of data. It’s becoming hard to track popular topics, gauge public opinion, or predict future trends from such massive and fast-changing content.

Challenges we ran into
While developing our social media trend analyzer, we faced challenges with managing massive, fast-paced data across platforms under API limitations. Privacy regulations and frequent platform updates required ongoing compliance and adaptability. Finally, delivering real-time insights and trend forecasts demanded scalable, advanced analytics to handle the volatility of social media.
